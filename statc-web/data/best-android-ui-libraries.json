DevByte videos are short videos made by the Google Android developer relations team to introduce new developer features on Android. They're also a great way to stay up to date with new features as they come out as well as tips and best practices. This app fetches the DevByte video list from the network using the Retrofit library and displays it on the screen. It uses a ViewModel and LiveData to hold the data and update the UI. Since the video list is big, results are displayed in a RecyclerView.","fullName":"rowelorbaneja\/DevBytes","updatedAt":"2020-05-20T08:49:26Z","gitUrl":"https:\/\/github.com\/rowelorbaneja\/DevBytes","license":null,"forks":0,"stargazersCount":0}]}
