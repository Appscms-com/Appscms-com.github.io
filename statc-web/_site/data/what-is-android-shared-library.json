I gave them a way to go through each opponent and decide whether they will win or lose that game. Every fan does it i have done it multiple times every season. Developed for android API 16-21 the UI format uses a drawer layout to display the 32 teams in a listview layout. The user selects the desired team and a fragment transition loads the specific team data from a file packaged with the APK. Each game is presented with a custom button interface that allows a single click to transition from Win \/ Loss. when the user selects a game condition the record will be displayed at the top of the fragment view. The user is given an option to share what he\/she has decided to other users via other apps that take a receive data intent. The application uses the v7 support library(app compact) with newly android lollipop to enhance and give the feel of the material design provided from the new android API 21.
