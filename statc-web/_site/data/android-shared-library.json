While developing the apps, we realized that we\u2019re coding for many common features in all the apps.

So it needs to be reduced for all to save the development time with ease. This is how an idea popped in our mind, and we decided to develop an SDK which can reduce developers\u2019 time and efforts.","fullName":"Rainer-Lang\/android","updatedAt":"2020-07-06T16:36:08Z","gitUrl":"https:\/\/github.com\/Rainer-Lang\/android","license":null,"forks":463,"stargazersCount":1},{"name":"live-preferences","language":"Kotlin","description":"Live Shared Preferences library for Android","fullName":"ibrahimsn98\/live-preferences","updatedAt":"2020-10-12T15:33:30Z","gitUrl":"https:\/\/github.com\/ibrahimsn98\/live-preferences","license":"MIT License","forks":11,"stargazersCount":58},{"name":"FastSave-Android","language":"Java","description":"An Android library for fast and easy access to Android Shared preferences.","fullName":"yehiahd\/FastSave-Android","updatedAt":"2020-08-05T03:33:36Z","gitUrl":"https:\/\/github.com\/yehiahd\/FastSave-Android","license":"Apache License 2.0","forks":14,"stargazersCount":75},{"name":"SharedPreferenceInspector","language":"Java","description":"Android Library to inspect shared preferences.","fullName":"PrashamTrivedi\/SharedPreferenceInspector","updatedAt":"2020-02-16T12:53:38Z","gitUrl":"https:\/\/github.com\/PrashamTrivedi\/SharedPreferenceInspector","license":"Apache License 2.0","forks":3,"stargazersCount":77}]}
