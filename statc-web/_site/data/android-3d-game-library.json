It is built off of the libGDX libraries and currently includes working Collision Detection using Box2D and a self-made algorithm. The current build is a test map where the player can walk around. The player can also enter the house; however, it only leads to another test map. Animation is also implemented and the code has a scalable structure for future development.  I was working with a 3D Art student from CSU to create this. He helped with some of the design; however the code is all written by myself. It has been put aside for now as we've both become to busy to work on such a time-consuming project; however may be picked up again in the future.","fullName":"trevermock\/2D-Open-World-RPG","updatedAt":"2020-01-09T22:12:32Z","gitUrl":"https:\/\/github.com\/trevermock\/2D-Open-World-RPG","license":null,"forks":1,"stargazersCount":1}]}
